"# Gadget-Company-Sales-Performance-Analysis" 
I created a Sales Performance Dashboard from the sales dataset of a gadget company. 

The gadget company is a national company that does business in 31 states across all geopolitical zones of Nigeria. They have 6 product categories: Computers; Cameras and camcorders; TV and Video; Cell phones; Audio; Music, Movies, and Audiobooks. 

# I provided insights about the performance of the gadget company across:
- sales channels, 
- zones and states, and 
- product categories.

# Project Steps:
- Import the dataset into PowerBI
- Transform the dataset using Power Query:
  - Data assessment
  - Data cleaning
  - Using DAX to create custom columns and measures 
- Build the Sales Performance Dashboard
- Publish to PowerBI service

# Recommendations:
- Review pricing strategy to ensure that prices are competitive.
- Invest in online marketing campaigns to increase online sales in states where they are currently low
- Diversify the product portfolio to include more products in the cell phone category due to the significant increase in order volume.
- Increase promotions and marketing in high ROI, low-sales states like Adamawa, Bayelsa, Oyo, and FCT.
- Consider expanding to other states of Nigeria, particularly cosmopolitan Lagos.
