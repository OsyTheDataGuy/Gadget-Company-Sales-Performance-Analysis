# Gadget Company Sales Performance Analysis using PowerBI
I created a Sales Performance Dashboard from the sales dataset of a gadget company.

The gadget company is a national company that does business in 31 states across all geopolitical zones of Nigeria. They have 6 product categories: Computers; Cameras and camcorders; TV and Video; Cell phones; Audio; Music, Movies, and Audiobooks. 

## I provided insights about the performance of the gadget company across:
- sales channels, 
- zones and states, and 
- product categories.

## Project Steps:
- Import the dataset into PowerBI
- Transform the dataset using Power Query:
  - Data assessment
  - Data cleaning
  - Using DAX to create custom columns and measures 
- Build the Sales Performance Dashboard
- Publish to PowerBI service

## Recommendations:
- Review pricing strategy to ensure that prices are competitive.
- Invest in online marketing campaigns to increase online sales in states where they are currently low
- Diversify the product portfolio to include more products in the cell phone category due to the significant increase in order volume.
- Increase promotions and marketing in high ROI, low-sales states like Adamawa, Bayelsa, Oyo, and FCT.
- Consider expanding to other states of Nigeria, particularly cosmopolitan Lagos.

## CONCLUSION
By addressing the decline in revenue in key product categories and states, using promotions strategically to avoid margin erosion, and expanding their online presence in certain states, the company can reduce risk and increase revenue.

## LIMITATIONS
- The Sales_Details dataset only covers a limited time period, and the findings may not necessarily hold true in the long run.
- We only analysed sales data and did not consider external factors such as customer behaviour/demographics, market/economic trends, or competitor behaviour.
